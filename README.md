# Curling Timer
In this repo you will find the code to the curling timer. This project started, because I noticed a lot of teams had problems managing their time without an actual timer (thinking time). So for the Dutch National Championships I made a simple webapp to display the timer on a screen. You just need to send the link to any computer and they can display it, as long as their browser is compatible. After the Champiships I descided to upgrade the app and make everything customizable, including the logo displayed and the color. Everything you make is stored locally in your browser, so make sure to save the url after start. This way you can always keep your custom made timer.

## How to use 
Just go to https://imdutch21.github.io/CurlingTimer. Here you can create a new timer. Enter all the fields, add as many timer elements as you want (these are pretty much slides that go on for a certain time). After you have filled in all the fields, press create timer. Then press start on the correct timer to go to the timer view.

## How to run locally
Run npm install and ng serve --open in the root folder to start the app
